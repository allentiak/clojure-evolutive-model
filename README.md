## Use cases list (YYYY/MM/DD)

In Argentina, we have:

- [X] Weekly non-working days (Ex.: every Sunday)
- [X] Annual leave (Ex.: every 25th of December is a holiday, no matter which year it belongs to)
- [X] Punctual holidays (2020/6/15 was an arbitrary holiday, as it was the 200th anniversary of the death of one of our National Heroes (Martín Miguel de Güemes). Normally, it is a working day.)
- [X] "Since holiday date" annual holiday (Ex.: since 2005, every 3/24 is a non-working mourning day, to commemorate all the victims of the last dictatorship's State terrorism.)
